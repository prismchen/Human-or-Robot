# Kaggle-Data-Mining-Project-Human-or-Robot

## Goal:

Predict if an online bid is made by a machine or a human, with input data src/features.csv which is the preprocessed table  with 290 attributes for each budder id. 

## Introduction:

Three algorithms are explored to learn the problem: gradient boost, adaboost, and random forest, which give accuracies floating around 90%, 89% and 93%.
	
For random forest, the optimal prediction is achieved with:
	
- number of decision trees: 200
- max depth of tree: 30
- number of samples allocated per tree: 65% of total training samples
- ratio of negative sample to positive sample allocated for each tree: 4
- number of attributes for selecting at each node of tree: 45 

## Usage:

	cd src
	python ramdonForest.py

## Check result:

Move to https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot, make a submission using the csv file generated by the python code.
